# Plexify.sh

A robust Bash script designed to transform messy media folders into organized, Plex-compatible structures. It standardizes naming conventions, manages subtitles, and automates directory cleanup.


## Usage
Run the script against a target directory:

`plexify [OPTIONS] <TARGET_DIRECTORY>`

### Options
- `-x`: **Execute.** Required to perform actual file renames and deletions.
- `-c`: **Clean.** Triggers internal file renaming and the removal of junk files.
